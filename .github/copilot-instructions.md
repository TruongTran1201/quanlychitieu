This project is a simple savings management website built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The goal is to allow users to add, view, and delete savings entries, and to prepare the app for free hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Render).

- Prioritize clean, modern UI/UX.
- Use functional React components and hooks.
- Keep the codebase modular and easy to extend.
- Prepare for easy backend/API integration if needed.
